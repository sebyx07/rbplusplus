    # Sometimes, type manipulation, moving nodes around, or flat
    # ignoring nodes just doesn't do the trick and you need to write
    # your own custom wrapper code. This method is for that. There are
    # two parts to custom code: the declaration and the wrapping.
    #
    # The Declaration:
    #   This is the actual custom code you write. It may need to take
    #   a pointer to the class type as the first parameter
    #   and follow with that any parameters you want.
    #
    # The Wrapping
    #   The wrapping is the custom (usually one-line) bit of Rice code that
    #   hooks up your declaration with the class in question. To ensure that
    #   you doesn't need to know the variable of the ruby class object,
    #   use <class> and rb++ will replace it as needed.
    #
    # Example (taken from Ogre.rb's wrapping of Ogre)
    #
    #   decl = <<-END
    #   int RenderTarget_getCustomAttributeInt(Ogre::RenderTarget* self, const std::string& name) {
    #     int value(0);
    #     self->getCustomAttribute(name, &value);
    #     return value;
    #   }
    #   END
    #   wrapping = "<class>.define_method(\"get_custom_attribute_int\", &RenderTarget_getCustomAttributeInt);"
    #
    #   ogre.classes("RenderTarget").add_custom_code(decl, wrapping)
    #
    # This method works as an aggregator, so feel free to use it any number
    # of times for a class, it won't clobber any previous uses.
