    # Single argument constructors of a class are called Conversion constructors.
    # They manage the conversion of one type to another. Rice handles this functionality
    # through a special method, define_implicit_cast<From, To>().
    #
    # Use this method to specify which constructors are meant to be used in implicit casting.
    # This will mark the constructor as such and won't wrap it directly, but will build an
    # appropriate define_implicit_cast<> call for the two types (class and argument)
    #
    # This method can be called per Constructor or per Class.
